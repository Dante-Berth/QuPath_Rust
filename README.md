# QuPath_Rust

An accelerated Rust implementation of parts of [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/),
reproducing its logic with a data layout suited to bulk analysis.

## Licence

GPLv3, matching QuPath. This code is written by reading QuPath's source in order
to reproduce its behaviour, which makes it a derivative work.

## Design principles

- **Objects are columnar.** Detections and their measurements are a struct of
  arrays — one contiguous column per feature, one row per object — rather than
  QuPath's per-object string-keyed measurement map. This is the main source of
  the speedup, not the choice of language.
- **Parity is the test suite.** Behaviour is checked against output recorded
  from QuPath itself, at documented tolerances. Intentional differences are
  recorded in [DIVERGENCES.md](DIVERGENCES.md).
- **Performance claims carry evidence.** Every claim is backed by committed
  benchmark output stating machine, thread count, and fixture.

## Status

Early. The columnar object table (`crates/qupath-objects`) exists and is tested
against QuPath's documented semantics. Measurement computation, parity
harness, and benchmarks are in progress.

## Building

Rust: `cargo test` — no system dependencies.

QuPath (for parity fixtures and benchmarks) needs **JDK 25**. The Gradle wrapper
cannot auto-provision it from a JDK below 17, so point it at a JDK 25 explicitly:

```bash
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-25 ./qupath/gradlew -p qupath :qupath-core:jar
```

The `qupath/` directory is an upstream QuPath checkout and is not tracked here.
